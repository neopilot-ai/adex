# Codex — From Prompt to Production: Full Roadmap & TODO

**Purpose:** Build an Agentic Development Environment (ADE) inside Codex that supports the full software lifecycle: from prompt → code generation → review → edit → ship → monitor → maintain. This document is a practical, prioritized, engineering-first roadmap with epics, milestones, concrete TODOs, suggested repo layout, and example tickets ready for implementation.

---

## Vision & Principles

* **Vision:** Empower developers to go from an English prompt (with context: files, images, URLs, logs) to shippable production features with minimal friction, while keeping humans fully in control.
* **Principles:**

  * *Human-in-the-loop* — every automated action is visible and reversible.
  * *Observable & auditable* — every agent decision, generated diff, and deployment must be traceable.
  * *Composable agents* — agents are small, specialized, and chainable.
  * *Lean UX* — lightweight editor, diff-first workflows, minimal modal interruptions.
  * *Secure by default* — secrets, credentials, and PII are protected at every layer.

---

## High-level Feature Set (user-facing)

1. **Prompt-to-Feature Flow** (Main Workflow)

   * Prompt input (text, images, URLs, upload files, select code lines)
   * Context capture (auto-detect repo, open files, test coverage, architecture map)
   * Agent proposals: one or more candidate diffs/PRs with explanations
   * In-line diff review UI (comment, request edit, re-prompt specific hunk)
   * Apply/Commit & open PR flow (with branch naming, PR body auto-write)
   * CI/CD scaffolding & deploy hooks (create preview envs, feature flags)

2. **Agenting Suite**

   * *Spec agent* — from prompt create requirements, tests, and acceptance criteria
   * *Code agent* — write code changes with file-level edit streams
   * *Test generator agent* — create unit/integration/e2e tests for changes
   * *Reviewer agent* — automated code review producing annotated diffs
   * *Debug agent* — analyze logs and suggest fixes; produce patch candidates
   * *Release agent* — create releases, changelogs, and deployment plans

3. **Lightweight Code Editor + Diff Review**

   * Side-by-side diff viewer
   * Accept/reject hunks, inline edits, suggestions
   * Re-prompt an agent scoped to a hunk or file

4. **Production Integration**

   * Integrate with CI providers (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
   * Auto-open PRs, run tests, create preview environments
   * Integrate with logging (Sentry, Datadog, CloudWatch) to triage errors
   * Feature flag integration & gradual rollout flows

5. **Observability & Post-ship**

   * Log analysis UI: point an agent at selected logs/stack traces
   * Correlate generated changes with metrics (latency, errors), rollbacks
   * Audit trail and change history for compliance

6. **Developer Tooling**

   * VS Code / JetBrains plugins (live agent interaction inside IDE)
   * CLI for headless usage and integration into automation
   * GitHub bot / GitHub App offering PR generation and conversational threads

7. **Governance, Security & Policies**

   * Safe defaults for secrets, IP scanning, license scanning
   * RBAC, team-level policy controls (e.g., PRs require human approval)
   * Explainability: why agent made a change, confidence scores

## Example Ticket Bank (ready to convert into GitHub Issues)

### FE-001: Prompt Composer

**Description:** Add a prompt composer that accepts text, files (drag & drop), and URLs. Attach selected files from repo context.
**Acceptance Criteria:** Prompt can be sent to backend; attachments are stored; composer shows contextual hints.

### BE-002: Agent Orchestrator - Streaming Patch

**Description:** Build an orchestrator endpoint that accepts a prompt + repo snapshot and streams line-level edits which are converted to a git patch.
**Acceptance Criteria:** Backend returns patch candidates; streaming works with websocket and graceful reconnect.

### AG-003: Reviewer Agent - Initial Ruleset

**Description:** Implement a reviewer agent that uses static analysis (linters) + model review to produce comments and a summarized rationale.
**Acceptance Criteria:** For a PR candidate, agent outputs comment list and confidence score.

### IN-004: GitHub App - Create PR Flow

**Description:** Implement GitHub App that can create branches, push commits, and create PRs with generated body.
**Acceptance Criteria:** App can create PR with `codex/feature/*` branch and link to session recording.

```

---

## Security, Safety & Responsible AI Considerations

* Model outputs should be validated by static analysis (linters, type checks) and, where possible, unit-test execution in sandboxed runners.
* Prompt & context redaction for secrets; never send raw secret values to external models.
* Policy engine for organization-level restrictions: e.g., disallow auto-creating dockerfiles, or limit network calls.
* Explainability UI: show which files, lines, tests, and examples the agent used to justify its change.
* Human-in-the-loop gates: require approvals based on risk scoring (sensitive files, infra changes require human signoff).

---

## Observability & Metrics (What to measure)

* **Product metrics:** prompt → accepted PR rate, time from prompt → merged PR, # prompts / active users
* **Quality metrics:** test pass rate for generated PRs, revert rate, post-ship bug rate
* **Model metrics:** hallucination rate, reviewer agreement with human reviewers
* **Safety metrics:** number of secrets leaked, policy violations triggered
* **Operational metrics:** agent execution latency, queue depth, error rates

---

## Rollout & Adoption Plan

1. **Internal dogfooding** (Weeks 1–6) — use Codex on internal microservices
2. **Pilot with small external teams** (Weeks 6–12) — 3–5 trusted partners
3. **Beta release** (Weeks 12–24) — broader public signups, gather feedback
4. **GA** (Weeks 24+) — enterprise onboarding, SSO and billing

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** Hallucinated or insecure code shipped.

  * *Mitigation:* Force test execution in sandbox, static analysis, and human approval for high-risk files.
* **Risk:** Privacy leakage via prompts or context.

  * *Mitigation:* Strong client-side redaction and policy checks before sending to external models.
* **Risk:** Poor UX leads to low adoption.

  * *Mitigation:* Lean UX with keyboard-first flows and IDE plugins.
* **Risk:** Cost & scalability of model calls.

  * *Mitigation:* Use hybrid approach (small models for scaffolding, large models for complex reasoning), caching, and partial-generation strategies.

---

## 90-Day Tactical Plan (Concrete)

**Week 0–2**

* Kickoff, define v1 language scope, set up sample repos, finalize MVP acceptance criteria.
* Skeleton repos & CI pipelines.

**Week 2–6**

* Build backend orchestrator (streaming + patch generation).
* Basic web UI: prompt composer + patch viewer.
* GitHub integration: create branch + PR functionality.
* Internal dogfooding begins.

**Week 6–12**

* Hunk-level diff actions (accept/reject), re-prompt scoping.
* Build reviewer agent and test generator agent.
* Basic VS Code alpha extension with prompt panel.
* Start Beta signups & initial pilot

---

## 12-Month Strategic Roadmap (Themes)

* **Month 0–3:** Build the core flow end-to-end (MVP)
* **Month 3–6:** Expand agent library (debugging, testing), improve UX, and early IDE integrations
* **Month 6–9:** Scale infra, enterprise features, security hardening, multi-language
* **Month 9–12:** Monitoring & post-ship automation, advanced safety tooling, marketplace for community agents

---

## Suggested Success Criteria

* 30% reduction in average time-to-merge for small features in pilot teams
* ≥70% of prompts produce PR candidates that pass CI and human review with minimal edits
* <2% secrets leakage or policy violations detected in Beta
* Positive NPS from pilot users (>6 average)
